## Centrifuge Platform: A New Era of Quests and Tasks in the Cosmos Ecosystem

“Centrifuge - a machine that is used to train cosmonauts before they go into space.”

### Introduction

Gamification of the educational process and engaging people in project activities by creating tasks that reward participants upon completion is one of the most effective tools for developing projects and communities. 

The growth of projects and communities has become closely tied to platforms for creating quests and tasks, with platforms like Zealy, BBlock, and Galaxy dominating in the launch and development of projects and communities. 
Initially, these platforms offered their services for free, but as their popularity grew, these services became paid. 

Projects spend huge amounts to pay for the functionality and services of such platforms to retain users and maintain the activity of their communities. 
At the same time, many non-commercial projects, which play an important role in creating non-economic values (cultural and psychological values, decentralized governance, human rights protection, ecological and humanitarian education), have become hostages of this situation: their community development activities were heavily dependent on these platforms, but due to the commercialization of functionality, they lost the ability to continue their activities as they could not afford to pay for the functionality and services of these platforms. Moreover, there are no alternative open-source platforms for creating quests and tasks.

It is obvious that in the list of public goods, we lack a platform for creating quests and tasks... So let’s fix this!

### Brief Description

Centrifuge is an open-source interchain platform for creating quests and tasks, which will enable the development of projects and communities both within and outside the Cosmos Ecosystem! To connect to Centrifuge, a project or user only needs a Keplr, Cosmostation, and/or Leap Wallet crypto-wallet. Projects can create quests and tasks and set rewards for their completion. Users can complete quests and tasks to receive rewards. Posting and completing quests and tasks are transactions in the Cosmos Hub.

### How It Works

A user can connect to the Centrifuge platform as a Project and/or Cosmonaut.

When connecting as a Project:
- Projects can create their project profile
- From their profile, Projects can create and post quests and tasks, as well as set rewards for completing these quests and tasks
- Projects can specify rewards in experience points or crypto
- Rewards can be set for completing a single task or for a quest (completing a series of related tasks)

When connecting as an Cosmonaut:
- Cosmonauts can explore Project profiles and see available quests and tasks, along with the rewards for completing them
- Cosmonauts can choose a quest or task, complete it, and receive a reward for the completed quest or task

The Centrifuge platform allows Projects to create quests and tasks with automatic verification or manual verification (depending on the Project's preference). 
For Cosmonauts, the Centrifuge platform provides the opportunity to confirm the completion of a quest or task in the manner specified by the Project.

Creating a project profile, posting quests and tasks, specifying rewards, choosing quests and tasks, and confirming the completion of quests and tasks are all transactions in the Cosmos Hub, ensuring that the information is verifiable and provable.

Projects can be confident that their quests and tasks are completed, and Cosmonauts can be assured that they will receive rewards for completing quests and tasks.

Based on data from the Cosmos Hub blockchain, the Centrifuge platform creates ratings for Projects and Cosmonauts and displays these ratings to users in the format and by the metrics they choose.

## Advantages of Centrifuge

### Economic Benefit

Currently, Zealy is the cheapest platform for posting quests and tasks, but its cost starts at $549 per month ($6588 per year). For many projects and communities, these are significant expenses. The BBlock and Galaxy platforms are even more expensive, starting at $15,000.

Centrifuge offers the same functionality for a significantly lower fee. Projects pay a one-time project profile registration fee of 1 ATOM (payment can be negotiated or even set by voting on a proposal in the Cosmos Hub), as well as transaction fees in the Cosmos Hub. 
Posting a quest or task on the Centrifuge platform from the project profile is a transaction in the Cosmos Hub and also requires a transaction fee.

The low cost of transactions in the Cosmos Hub makes Centrifuge more accessible and attractive to many projects and communities compared to Zealy, BBlock, or Galaxy. 
Since each quest or task posting, selection, and completion confirmation on Centrifuge is a transaction in the Cosmos Hub network, this increases the total number of transactions, thereby increasing demand for ATOM. Interaction between Projects and Cosmonauts will lead to a constant increase in the number of transactions and add utility to the ATOM token, which will drive demand for ATOM in the market and, consequently, increase its price.

### Support for IBC Protocol

The primary target audience of Centrifuge is networks and projects in the Cosmos Ecosystem. 
At the time of writing, according to https://ping.pub/, there are 112 networks operating in the Cosmos Ecosystem. The number of projects in the Cosmos Ecosystem is incalculable, but it is certainly more than 1000.

Centrifuge will become a key platform for dApps, validators, communities, DAOs, gaming projects, and NFT collections in the Cosmos Ecosystem. 
To pay rewards for completing quests and tasks in own tokens, Projects from the Cosmos Ecosystem will transfer their tokens to the Cosmos Hub via the IBC-protocol, increasing the number of IBC-transactions to the Cosmos Hub from other networks in the Cosmos Ecosystem. 
Cosmonauts who receive rewards for completing quests and tasks in IBC-tokens will withdraw them to native networks, increasing the number of IBC-transactions from the Cosmos Hub to other networks in the Cosmos Ecosystem, which will also increase the useability of ATOM.

### Centrifuge Potential

Zealy Cosmos Ecosystem stopped functioning after the introduction of paid services by Zealy. 
Over one year, only in the Zealy Cosmos Ecosystem, 42 Projects were added, over 10,000 quests and tasks were posted, and in total, users completed 1,164,425 tasks in one year! 
Detailed information can be found here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xd6jgOPkCyMhAl4YexnGU8BawEHj-oY8eVnH_4qkbsQ/edit?usp=sharing

If the Zealy Cosmos Ecosystem had been on the Centrifuge platform, this would have brought an additional 1,164,425 transactions to the Cosmos Hub! 
At the time of writing, the total number of transactions in the Cosmos Hub throughout its existence is 71,650,000. 
Thus, simply transferring the Zealy Cosmos Ecosystem to Centrifuge would have increased the total number of transactions in the Cosmos Hub by 1.6% in one year!

With good marketing and information support from AADAO, Cosmos Twitter, and Cosmos Ecosystem Twitter, hundreds or even a thousand projects will migrate to Centrifuge, which will increase the number of transactions in the Cosmos Hub by 2-3 times.

With the implementation of ICS 2.0 and the increase in the number of consumer chains, more projects will come to Centrifuge, and/or migrate from Zealy, BBlock, or Galaxy to Centrifuge platform, which could make Centrifuge the primary provider of transactions in the Cosmos Hub.

## Conclusion

Centrifuge offers a more affordable and efficient solution for creating quests and tasks in the Cosmos Ecosystem. 
With integration with crypto wallets, support for the IBC-protocol, and economic benefits, it has the potential to become the leading platform for interaction between projects and cosmonauts, contributing to the growth of transactions and the use of ATOM in the Cosmos Hub.
